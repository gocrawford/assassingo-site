Ready to play the ultimate social stealth game? AssassinGo brings the classic game of Assassin to life with a digital twist!

AssassinGo transforms your everyday environment into a thrilling battleground. Each player receives secret missions to "eliminate" specific targets at designated locations using particular items. Snap a photo of your successful hit to earn points and climb the leaderboard. But watch your back—someone is always hunting you!

# HOW IT WORKS: Photo Elimination!

## Create or join a game: 
One player becomes the Game Master, setting up locations, items, and game duration. Other players join using a unique game code.

## Receive your assignment: 
Request an assignment at your preferred difficulty level. Easy missions award 100 points, medium missions 300 points, and challenging missions 500 points. Your assignment will specify:
* Your target player
* A specific location
* A required item

## Execute the mission:
Track down your target at the designated location, ensure they're holding the required item, say "Gotcha" and take a photo as proof.

## Watch the feed:
Every successful elimination appears in the activity feed, complete with photos and details—keeping all players informed and the competition fierce!

## Game modes:
SOLO MODE: Every agent for themselves in an all-out battle for supremacy.
TEAM MODE: Form squads of agents, coordinate your hunts, and share the glory (and points)!

## Key Features:
MISSION SYSTEM: Dynamically generated assignments with adjustable difficulty levels.
PHOTO VERIFICATION: Capture proof of your successful eliminations.
REAL-TIME ACTIVITY FEED: See who eliminated whom, where, and how.
LIVE LEADERBOARD: Track scores throughout the game.
TEAM COORDINATION: Work together on the same assignments in team mode.
ELIMINATION PENALTIES: When eliminated, you'll face a timeout period before returning to action.
GAME HISTORY: Review past games, kills, and final standings.

## Perfect For:
* Family vacations
* College dorms and campus activities
* Office team-building events
* Birthday parties and celebrations
* Friend groups looking for excitement
* Summer camps and youth programs

## Get Started:
Download AssassinGo today, gather your friends, and transform your ordinary surroundings into an extraordinary gaming experience. Remember: trust no one, watch your back, and eliminate your targets before they eliminate you!

Note: AssassinGo is a game of strategy and fun. Please play responsibly and always respect public spaces, private property, and the comfort of non-players. No actual harm comes to any players—this is a social deduction game using photography only.
