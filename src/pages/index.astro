**Mission: Photo elimination!**

Ready to play the ultimate social stealth game? AssassinGo brings the classic game of Assassin to life with a digital twist!

##THE GAME
AssassinGo transforms your everyday environment into a thrilling battleground. Each player receives secret missions to "eliminate" specific targets at designated locations using particular items. Snap a photo of your successful hit to earn points and climb the leaderboard. But watch your back—someone is always hunting you!

#HOW IT WORKS

##CREATE OR JOIN A GAME: 
One player becomes the Game Master, setting up locations, items, and game duration. Other players join using a unique game code.

##RECEIVE YOUR ASSIGNMENT: 
Request an assignment at your preferred difficulty level. Easy missions award 100 points, medium missions 300 points, and challenging missions 500 points. Your assignment will specify:
* Your target player
* A specific location
* A required item

##EXECUTE YOUR MISSION:
Track down your target at the designated location, ensure they're holding the required item, say "Gotcha" and take a photo as proof.

##WATCH THE FEED:
Every successful elimination appears in the activity feed, complete with photos and details—keeping all players informed and the competition fierce!

##GAME MODES
SOLO MODE: Every agent for themselves in an all-out battle for supremacy.
TEAM MODE: Form squads of agents, coordinate your hunts, and share the glory (and points)!

##KEY FEATURES
MISSION SYSTEM: Dynamically generated assignments with adjustable difficulty levels.
PHOTO VERIFICATION: Capture proof of your successful eliminations.
REAL-TIME ACTIVITY FEED: See who eliminated whom, where, and how.
LIVE LEADERBOARD: Track scores throughout the game.
TEAM COORDINATION: Work together on the same assignments in team mode.
ELIMINATION PENALTIES: When eliminated, you'll face a timeout period before returning to action.
GAME HISTORY: Review past games, kills, and final standings.
